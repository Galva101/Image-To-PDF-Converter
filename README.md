This python script takes a folder full of Images, currently specified as PNG,
crops their white border away, and creates a PDF file with those new images.

To run it, python is needed, and Reportlab, which can be done using:
pip install pillow reportlab

Please note, that the images are automatically saved, work with copies if you don't want to edit the originals.
Other file types work as well, they can be edited in the file, as well as the margins and the scaling inside the PDF.
